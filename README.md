My Home, by Ludo Bermejo

Just another 8-bits, awesome personal homepage. You can move with your cursor keys and with the mouse (a little broken pathfinding algorithm). 

It was started between jobs and ended when I was overhelmed; initially the code was good, but it ended like a sharkado disaster. But I think perhaps it would be useful for some people :)

Libraries used:

* Jquery
* Requirejs
* easeljs
* preloadJS
* modernizr
* detectMobile
* easyStar
* ndgmr.Collision
